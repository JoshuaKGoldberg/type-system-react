# Fun > 0. Type Printing

The `// ^?` comment is called a "twoslash" comment.
It's a nice little community standard that tells tooling to show what the type just above the `^` stringifies to.
Twoslash assertions are particularly useful when you're doing a lot of work in the type system.

Common TypeScript wrapper projects such as <typescriptlang.org/play> support it in some way.
The [Twoslash Query Comments VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-twoslash-queries) is enabled as a recommendation on this repository.
