# Foundations > 5. Type Aliases

Our types are starting to get to have a lot of syntax.
It would be nice if we could extract portions of them and give those portions friendly names.

TypeScript provides a feature for this called "type aliases".
The `type` keyword followed by any name, a `=`, and some type syntax says that whenever that name is used, the developer meant that type syntax.

This `index.ts` functions roughly the exact same as the previous one.
